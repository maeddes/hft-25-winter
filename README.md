Introduction to distributed systems - Overview Cloud Computing

### **Content Overview**

**Distributed Systems**
   - Difference distributed and non-distributed systems
   - Reasons to use/implement distributed-systems
   - Categories of heterogenity and resilience
   - Role communication protocols, service registry, distributed configuration
   - The fallacies of distributed computing


**The NIST Cloud Definition (2011)**
   - Breakdown of the NISTâ€™s five essential cloud characteristics, deployment models, and service models.
  
**Overview of Major Cloud Providers**
   - Key players in the cloud space (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.).
   - Comparing evolution.

**Cloud Service/Abstraction Models**
   - IaaS, PaaS, SaaS revisited, with modern examples.
   - The evolution of abstraction models, including FaaS and Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS).

**Introduction to CNCF**
   - Role of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) in the cloud ecosystem.
   - CNCF Landscape: technologies, tools, and projects.

**Popular Technologies**
   - **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration in cloud-native environments.
   - **eBPF**: Extending kernel capabilities for monitoring and security.
   - **OpenTelemetry**: Observability standards and practices in modern cloud systems.

### **Learning Objectives**
By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:
- Be able to describe what makes a distributed system a distributed system
- Elobarate on reasons - why to build a distributed architecture?
- Describe the NIST cloud definition and its significance in the modern cloud landscape.
- Identify the major cloud providers and tell about their evolution.
- Differentiate between cloud service models and discuss their evolution, including modern abstraction models like CaaS.
- Explain the role of CNCF and analyze the CNCF landscape to identify key technologies and trends.
- Provide an overview of Kubernetes  (,eBPF, and OpenTelemetry,) explaining their impact on cloud-native development.

### **Student/Review Questions**
#### For now:
1. What are the five essential characteristics of cloud computing according to NIST, and how do they apply to modern cloud services?
2. Identify 3 main cloud providers.
3. What are the differences between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS? Give examples of each in today's cloud ecosystem.
4. What is the CNCF, and why is it important in the context of cloud-native technologies?
5. Desribe 3 fallacies of distributed computing
6. What do you need to build a distributed system? What makes a distributed system a distributed system?
